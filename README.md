üîç About This Project

This project is a Python re-implementation of an algorithm originally developed in MATLAB, inspired by the research paper:
"Prediction of Hepatitis Disease Using Machine Learning Technique"
The original authors implemented the method in MATLAB, and I have re-created the workflow using Python to enhance compatibility with open-source environments and modern data science tools.
